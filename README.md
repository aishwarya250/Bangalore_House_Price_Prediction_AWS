# Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction_AWS

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

AWS Deployment: http://ec2-18-222-223-172.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/

- Housing price keep changing in day in and day
out and sometimes are hyped rather than being based on
valuation. Predicting housing prices with real factor is the
main crux of our project. Here we aim make our
evaluation based on every basic parameter that is
considered while determining the price
- Model is deployed on AWS EC2 instance.
- Using machine learning algorithms, we solve some
application in the real-world problem but would not be
complicated to implement. In this a house price prediction
we using regression algorithms to predicate the price of the
house.

### Files

There are two main notebooks, one is the cleaning notebook, where the data is cleaned and prepared for modeling and the other is the modeling notebook where the ML models and the model performance are compared,

```bash
Part-1 Data Preprocessing.ipynb
```  
and
```bash
Part-2 Model-Building.ipynb
```

### Results 
Here is the web application which takes the parameter and tells us the prediction probability and the factors on which it calculates.
